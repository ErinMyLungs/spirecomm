* First draft 'model' working
    * randomly chooses cards

* Using default drafter, score: 118
* Using random drafter: score: 88

Can now run through games and interact with client

Tomorrow:

Setup Neural net to take in cards and start adding weights?

Notes:
* 75x75 cardmatrix with 1x75 deck matrix output is best cards to add

* card matrix is symmetric
* SGA/SGD? Impurity metrics
* How to optimize finding weights of 75x75 matrix
    * 2850 weights to optimize
